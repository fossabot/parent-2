# Utility Annotations
This package offers annotations with class retention. Therefore it is required to be in class path on compile time, but must not be delivered for runtime purpose.

## Getting started
The package is part of the project [de.lars-sh:parent](../README.md).

In case you want to use this package separately, here's a Maven dependency example:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>de.lars-sh</groupId>
		<artifactId>utils-annotations</artifactId>
		<version><!-- TODO --></version>
		<scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>

To learn more about the available annotations check out the JavaDoc.
